        My imagination is stimulated by technology. Technology is enjoyable
        because the more I learn about it, the more I want to know. In the
        future technology would eventually enable me to offer solutions across
        all industries. As a Software Developer/ Engineer having been exposed to

        Cascading style sheets, or CSS. Simply put, CSS is a design language
        that enhances a website's visual appeal beyond that of plain or
        uninteresting text. The visual structure, layout, and aesthetics are
        determined by CSS, whereas the text content is mostly determined by
        HTML. HTML is a markup language, whereas CSS is a language for creating
        style sheets. When considering CSS, keep "look and feel" in mind.
